# Require all PR review conversations to be resolved before merge.
# Runs on: PR activity (open/sync/reopen), and any comment on the PR (conversation or inline).
# Note: GitHub does not emit an event when a conversation is "resolved" (button only).
# So the check re-runs when someone comments or pushes; after resolving, a new comment or push will re-run it.
