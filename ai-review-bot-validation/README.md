# AI-Review-Bot validation

**Main README has been moved to the repository root.** See **[../README.md](../README.md)** for full documentation, setup, and configuration.

This folder holds **sample code** only: **`review/`** — demo files (Java, Python, Ruby, Scala) for testing the bot’s inline comments and executive summary.
